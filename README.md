# Airbnb Data Analysis Project

This repository contains the code and resources for analyzing and visualizing the Airbnb dataset. The project is aimed at exploring various aspects of Airbnb listings, including pricing trends, availability analysis, geospatial distribution, and location-based insights.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Project Setup and Data Retrieval
- **Clone Repository**: Begin by cloning the GitHub repository containing your project files to your local machine or Google Colab.
- **MongoDB Setup**: Set up your MongoDB Atlas cluster if you haven't already. Replace the connection string in the `1_MongoDB_Connection_and_Data_Retrieval.ipynb` notebook with your cluster's connection string.
- **Upload to Colab (if using)**: If using Google Colab, upload the necessary files (`1_MongoDB_Connection_and_Data_Retrieval.ipynb`, `2_Data_Cleaning_and_Preparation.ipynb`, etc.) to your Colab environment.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preparation
- **Data Cleaning**: Use the `2_Data_Cleaning_and_Preparation.ipynb` notebook to clean the Airbnb dataset. Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and prepare the data for analysis.

### 3. Price Analysis and Visualization
- **Price Analysis**: Use the `4_Price_Analysis_and_Visualization.ipynb` notebook to analyze and visualize price variations across different locations, property types, and seasons.

### 4. Availability Analysis
- **Availability Analysis**: Utilize the `5_Availability_Analysis_by_Season.ipynb` notebook to analyze the availability of Airbnb listings based on seasonal variations.

### 5. Location-Based Insights
- **Location-Based Insights**: Explore location-based insights using the `6_Location_Based_Insights.ipynb` notebook. This can include variations in prices across different regions and neighborhoods.

### 6. Interactive Visualizations
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Develop dynamic and interactive visualizations using the `7_Interactive_Visualizations.ipynb` notebook. This allows users to filter and explore the data interactively.

### 7. Dashboard Creation
- **Dashboard Creation**: Use Tableau or Power BI to create a comprehensive dashboard (found in the `8_Dashboard_Creation` directory) providing a summarized view of key insights from the analysis.

### 8. Finalize and Share
- **Save and Share**: Save your work periodically. If using Google Colab, ensure to save it to your Google Drive or GitHub to preserve progress and facilitate sharing.
